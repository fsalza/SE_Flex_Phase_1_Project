# SE_Flex_Phase_1_Project
This is the repository for Fulvio Salza's SE Flex Phase 1 Project.

For my Phase 1 Project, I decided to use a topic that was of interest to me. It's currently NBA Playoffs time, and I am an adamant Knicks fan!

I decided to incorporate my interest in the NBA into this project, and found an API that would give basic information on teams in the NBA, such as name, abbreviation, division, and so forth. I decided to build off of this information that was provided by the API to add number of championships, as well as photos of the team logos to make the application more visually pleasing. I thought of creating an application where you could search a player and also use a dropdown for which team a given player is on, to then populate a card to the DOM that showed some of this basic information.
