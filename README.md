# SE_Flex_Phase_1_Project

This is the repository for Fulvio Salza's SE Flex Phase 1 Project. Phase 1 at the Flatiron School asks students to create a Single Page Application using the skills learned over the first two months of the program, mainly in JavaScript.

For my Phase 1 Project, I decided to use a topic that was of interest to me. It's currently NBA Playoffs time, and I am an adamant Knicks fan!

I decided to incorporate my interest in the NBA into this project, and found an API that would give basic information on teams in the NBA, such as name, abbreviation, division, and so forth. I decided to build off of this information that was provided by the API to add number of championships, as well as photos of the team logos to make the application more visually pleasing. I thought of creating an app where fans of each team could come in and drop a like for their favorite teams, as a way to gauge popularity among NBA franchises. The app has filter functionality so that instead of searching the whole page for a team, one can simply select a team from the dropdown and drop a like, or as many as they please. Each like gets stored in the server, so that the running totals are saved to gauge a team's popularity.
